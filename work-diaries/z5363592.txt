Week 1

In week 1 we met up together to form our group TheCarrothead, I was selected as the scrum master
and we compiled a list of projects that we would be happy doing, picking p16, p18 and p2 prioritised in highest to lowest order

Week 2

In week 2 we started becoming familiar with the Jira website that we were going to use and set up our page.
Decided on using NextJS for front end, python (flask) for backend. We divided our roles up into frontend and backend, with myself and Daniel Nguyen.
Daniel Wang, Victor and Akul are going to work on the backend, but I think these roles are not super strictly divided as there are more backend developers,
we may sometimes ask for some help but in general those are the roles we are going to work with. We started filling out our project backlog with user stories.
Our client set up a meeting on zoom, which one of our members was able to participate in and we asked some questions with regards to the specifications required.

Week 3

In week 3 we began setting up our backend and frontend to get a start on our assignment. A basic api document was created for our first sprint. We also finalised 
our proposal, and then set up a meeting to create all our child issues. We've started sorting out the work with everyone and assigning tasks as well in the leadup
to our first demo.
